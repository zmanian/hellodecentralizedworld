## About Hello Decentralized World
The aim of this project is to offer a visual tool that displays all the active projects in the Blockchain ecosystem.
I would like to prove that Blockchains are not only about Cryptocurrencies and that Cryptocurrencies are not only about buying and selling. 

## Special Thanks to:
I would've not been able to build this website in such short time without the following open-source projects.
A big, huge thanks to all of you:
- Bootstrap 3
- Shuffle.js
- jQuery throttle / debounce
- AcasA Programming
